      Enter data about the design of processing heating equipment. This allows the user to compare PHAST calculations to the design
      of the equipment. This method calculates total energy used by a furnace by multiplying total rated capacity of burners
      (Btu/hr) used in different heat zones with annual operating hours, percentage rated capacity used and duty cycle.
