  <h3>Designed Energy Help</h3>
  <p>Enter data about the design of processing heating equipment. This allows the user to compare PHAST calculations to the
    design of the equipment. This method calculates total energy used by a furnace by multiplying total rated capacity of
    burners (Btu/hr) used in different heat zones with annual operating hours, percentage rated capacity used and duty cycle</p> -->
