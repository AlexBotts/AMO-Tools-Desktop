      Average Surface Temperature

      <small class="text-muted">
        Average temperature for the exposed wall surfaces. The average value should be calculated based on actual measurement at
        several locations for the furnace outside areas. The actual temperatures can vary over a wide range and care should
        be taken to use weighted average. use infra-red radiation temperature measurement (with proper emissivity correction)
        whenever possible.

        Temperature of the area where the equipment is located. In some cases it may be necessary to take temperature reading at
        the bottom or top of the equipment to make sure that the temperature is not much higher than the room-ambient temperature.
        Use weighted average if the temperature readings vary too much.

        installations it is necessary to measure wind velocity or use available data from other sources such as weather report.

      Savings Suggestions
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Look for cracks, breaks and erosion of insulation. Repair and maintain furnace insulation
        <br> Use proper insulation and thickness to reduce furnace casing or surface temperature while rebuilding the furnace
        <br> Consider use of low weight, fiber insulation when appropriate
        <br> Account for process atmosphere composition (i.e. presence of hydrogen) in the furnace. Select the insulation to
        provide barrier to gas penetration in the insulation voids
        <br> Reduce or eliminate external wall cooling if used
        <hr> Note: These energy saving measures are for guidance only. Not all measures are applicable under all operating conditions.
        There may additional measures when considering specific situations and the user is encouraged to review and apply
        the appropriate measures
