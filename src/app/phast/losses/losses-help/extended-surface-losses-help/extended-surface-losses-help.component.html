      <p>Total area of the exposed parts such as shafts, structural components of the furnace, part of the charge being
        heated (if applicable), burner or radiant tubes, material handling system (conveyors, belts) etc. Estimate

    <p>
      Average temperature for the exposed areas. The average should be calculated based on actual measurement at
      several locations for the exposed parts or areas. The actual temperature can vary over a wide range and care
      should be taken to use weighted average. Use infra-red radiation temperature measurement instrument (with
      proper emissivity correction) whenever possible.

      Temperature of the area outside the furnace where the exposed areas are located. In most cases this is the

    <p>
      Emissivity of the surface from heat is dissipated or lost. This can be in the range of 07 to 0.9 for commonly
      encountered surfaces but the user should use appropriate value for the specific case.
