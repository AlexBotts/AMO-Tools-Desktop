  <h3>Metered Energy Help</h3>
  <p>Enter data about the energy of processing heating equipment based on metered steam use. This allows the user to compare
    PHAST calculations to the meter data of the equipment. This method calculates total energy used by a furnace by multiplying
    metered steam energy used by the measurement period (hours/days/weeks).</p>
