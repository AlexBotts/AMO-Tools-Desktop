    <small class="text-muted">
      Enter data about the energy of processing heating equipment based on metered steam use. This allows the user to compare PHAST
      calculations to the meter data of the equipment. This method calculates total energy used by a furnace by multiplying
      metered steam energy used by the measurement period (hours/days/weeks).
