          PSAT
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Pumping System Assessment Tool (PSAT) is a free desktop software tool to help industrial users assess the efficiency
          of pumping system operations. PSAT uses achievable pump performance data from Hydraulic Institute standards and
          motor performance data from the MotorMaster+ database to calculate potential energy and associated cost savings.
          The tool also enables users to save and retrieve log files, default values, and system curves for sharing analyses
          with other users.
        </p>
        <h5>
          Intended Users

        <p>
          The tool is designed for industrial plant managers and personnel who are interested in improving pumping system efficiency
          and measuring potential savings opportunities in both dollars and electrical energy savings.

        <p>
          The Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST) introduces methods to improve thermal efficiency of heating equipment.
          This tool helps industrial users survey process heating equipment that consumes fuel, steam, or electricity, and
          identifies the most energy-intensive equipment. The tool can be used to perform a heat balance that identifies
          major areas of energy use under various operating conditions and test "what-if" scenarios for various options to
          reduce energy use.
        </p>
        <h5>Intended Users</h5>
        <p>This tool is designed for industrial energy coordinators, plant managers and engineers who are interested in identifying
          potential energy-saving opportunities in process heating equipment.</p>
