      <h3>NEMA Energy Efficiency Help</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>NEMA</strong>(National Electrical Manufacturers Association) labeled electric motors are designed to
        assist purchasers in optimizing motor system efficiency, reducing electrical power consumption and costs, and
        improving system reliability. The predicted efficiency is based on a <strong>TEFC</strong>(Totally Enclosed,
        Fan-Cooled) Motor from NEMA MG1, based on size, rotating speed and efficiency class.
