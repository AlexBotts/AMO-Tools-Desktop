      A system-head curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and hydraulic losses in a
      given piping system. Since hydraulic losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of pipe, and size,
      number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

      A system resistance curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and pressure losses in a
      given fan system. Some pressure losses are functions of rate of flow, size and length of duct, and size,
      number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic curve and specific values.

      Specific Gravity
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of the fluid to water at standard condition.
        <br>
        This is used in calculating the fluid power and can be found through fluid property tables.
        <br>
        By default, this calue is for water at standard conditions.

      Compressibility Factor
      <br>
      <small class="text-muted">
        The compressibility factor is the measure of how non-ideal the gas is. For most gases this is usually around 1.

      System Loss Exponent, C

      <small class="text-muted">
        The system loss exponent, or system friction loss exponent, is that to which the flow rate is raised in
        developing friction loss estimates. The Darcy-Weisbach equation, applied to pipes or fittings, indicates a value
        of 2. However, increasing Reynolds number causes the net effect to be slightly less than 2.
        <br>
        While the difference is generally not significant, the default value is 1.8. Experiment with values between 1.8
        and 2.0 to see how the system curve changes.
