	  	<p>
        A system-head curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between flow and
      hydraulic losses in a given piping system. Since hydraulic losses are functions of rate of flow,
      size and length of pipe, and size, number and type of fittings, each system has its own characteristic
      curve and specific values.
      </p>
	  	<p>
        Flow Rate represents either the <u>measured</u> or <u>required</u> rate of flow.
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
        Head represents either the <u>measured</u> or <u>required</u> pump head in feet or meters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of the fluid to water at standard condition
      </p>
      <p>
        The system friction loss exponent is the exponent to which the flow rate is raised in developing friction loss
        estimates. The difference is generally not significant within the acceptable range from 1.8 to 2.0.
