          Given a measured pressure, elevation, flow rate, and line size data calculate the head for the pump.

          <u>Important note about loss coefficients</u><br>The loss coefficients used here apply to the velocity head in the
          line size represented by the suction and discharge pipe diameters at the points of pressure measurement</p>
        <p>
          If the loss elements are in different size lines than the points of pressure measurement, they need to be appropriately scaled.
          It is generally suggested that the losses be scaled in proportion to the 4th power of the diameter ratio. For example,
          if the discharge pressure is measured in a 12-inch header and there is a 6-inch check valve with a nominal loss
          coefficient of 2 (applied to the 6-inch valve size), the K factor to use for the valve would be 2 x (12/6) to the
          4th power, or 32, The reason for this 4th power scaling is that the velocity varies with the square of the pipe
          diameter, and the velocity head (to which the loss coefficients apply) is proportional to the velocity squared.
