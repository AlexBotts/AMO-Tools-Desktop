    Specific Speed Help
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      For each pump type there is an optimal specific speed based on pump speed, flow rate, and head. Operation at the
      optimal specific speed allows a pump to operate at maximum efficiency. Hydraulic Institute standards also include
      factors for wear and surface finish on wetted parts that are not considered in these calculations.
