      <h3>Specific Speed Help</h3>
      <p>
        For each pump type there is an optimal specific speed based on size, flow rate, specific speed.
        Hydraulic Institute standards also include factors for wear and surface finish on wetted parts but these two
        factors are not considered in the PSAT calculations. Operation at the optimal specific speed allows a pump to
        operate at maximum efficiency. This calculator determines the specific speed for a pump at the given conditions
        and calculates the amount of efficiency penalty to be deducted from the maximum value due to operation away
        from the optimal specific speed.
