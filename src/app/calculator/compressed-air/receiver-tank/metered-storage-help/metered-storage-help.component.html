    <p>In metered control, the rate of compressed air flowing to refill a secondary receiver is controlled. If the rate is not
      controlled, filling the receiver will become a demand event that may cause system problems due to high rate of flow.
      This is done to protect the entire system from intermittent application, which can cause header pressure fluctuations
      when it actuates. Here the storage volume is calculated and installed in the same manner as for protecting a critical
      application, but a needle valve is installed instead of a check valve.</p>
