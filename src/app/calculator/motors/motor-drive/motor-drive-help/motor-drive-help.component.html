      Adjust operating conditions to compare energy use and energy costs of different motor drive types.<br><br>
      Approximately one-third of the electric motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives.<br><br>
      Most belt drives use V-belts, which use a trapezoidal cross section to create a wedging action on the pulleys to increase friction and improve the belt’s power transfer capability. V-belt drives can have a peak efficiency of 95% or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5% over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned.<br><br>
      A notched belt has grooves or notches that run perpendicular to the belt’s length, which reduces the bending resistance of the belt. Notched belts can use the same pulleys as cross-section standard V-belts. They run cooler, last longer, and are about 2% more efficient than standard V-belts.<br><br>
      Synchronous belts (also called cogged, timing, positive-drive, or high-torque drive belts) are toothed and require the installation of mating grooved sprockets. These belts operate with a consistent efficiency of 98% and maintain their efficiency over a wide load range.<br><br>
      In addition, V-belts should be retensioned based on a scheduled preventive maintenance program for optimum performance. Each procedure takes approximately 30 minutes, during which the drive must be shut down and productivity is lost. On critical drives, a synchronous belt, which requires no retensioning, not only improves energy efficiency but also eliminates downtime.<br><br>
      Synchronous belts are the most efficient choice. However, notched belts may be a better choice when vibration damping is needed, retrofit of a synchronous belt is not cost effective, or shock loads cause abrupt torque changes that could shear a synchronous belt’s teeth.

      Also called load factor, defined as the ratio between actual load and rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually near 75% of rated load. Overloaded motors can overheat and lose efficiency. Underloaded motors, those loaded below 50 percent of rated load, are inefficient and exhibit low power factor. Surveys of installed motors indicate that a large portion of motors in use are improperly loaded.
