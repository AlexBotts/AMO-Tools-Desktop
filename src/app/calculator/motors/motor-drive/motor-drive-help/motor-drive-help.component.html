      Adjust operating conditions to compare energy use and energy costs of different motor drive types.
      <br>
      <br> Approximately one-third of the electric motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives most of which
      are V-belts, which can have a peak efficiency of 95% or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on
      pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, and under or oversizing belts for load requirements.
      Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5% over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned,
      which requires downtime.
      <br>
      <br> A notched belt has grooves or notches that run perpendicular to the beltâ€™s length, which reduces the bending resistance
      of the belt. They run cooler, last longer, and are about 2% more efficient than standard V-belts.
      <br>
      <br> Synchronous belts are toothed and require the installation of mating grooved sprockets. These belts operate with a
      consistent efficiency of 98% and maintain their efficiency over a wide load range. On critical drives, a synchronous
      belt, which requires no retensioning, not only improves energy efficiency but also eliminates downtime.

        Also called load factor, defined as the ratio between actual load and rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually near 75%
        of rated load. Overloaded motors can overheat and lose efficiency. Underloaded motors, those loaded below 50% of
        rated load, are inefficient and exhibit low power factor. Surveys of installed motors indicate that a large portion
        of motors in use are improperly loaded.
