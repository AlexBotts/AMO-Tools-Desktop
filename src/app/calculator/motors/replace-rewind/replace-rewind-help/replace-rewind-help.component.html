    <h3>Replace Rewind Motor</h3>
    <p>
      Although failed motors can usually be rewound, it is often worthwhile to 
      replace a damaged motor with a new energy-efficient model to save energy 
      and improve reliability. Have motors rewound only at reliable repair shops 
      that use low temperature (under 700Â°F) bake-out ovens, high quality materials, 
      and a quality assurance program based on EASA-Q or ISO-9000. Ask the repair 
      shop to conduct a core loss or loop test as part of their rewind procedures.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
      Select a new energy-efficient motor under any of the following conditions:
    </p>
    <li>The cost of the rewind exceeds 65% of the price of a new motor</li>
    <li>The motor was rewound before 1980</li>

          The ratio of the average load the motor draws when it is in 
          operation to full rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually 
          around 75% with drastic decreases in efficiency below about 50%. 
          If this is the case, consider replacing your motor with a correctly sized motor.

          Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical 
          work the motor performs and the electrical power it consumes to 
          do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage 
          represents a more efficient motor. Electric motor efficiency is 
          dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, 
          rating, load, power quality, and operating conditions. 
          Enter this value as a percentage.

          Rewinding a motor usually comes with a loss in efficiency somewhere 
          between 1 and 2%. When considering the choice between rewinding a 
          standard efficiency motor or purchasing a new high efficiency motor, 
          the difference in efficiency is around 4 to 5% in favor of the high 
          efficiency motor, which will also have a much longer service life.
