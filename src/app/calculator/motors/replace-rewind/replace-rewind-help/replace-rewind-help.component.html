    Replace Existing Motor - Efficiency Upgrade
    <br>
    <small class="text-muted">
      Although failed motors can usually be rewound, it is often worthwhile to replace a damaged motor with a new energy-efficient
      model to save energy and improve reliability. Have motors rewound only at reliable repair shops that use low temperature
      (under 700Â°F) bake-out ovens, high quality materials, and a quality assurance program based on EASA-Q or ISO-9000.
      Ask the repair shop to conduct a core loss or loop test as part of their rewind procedures. Select a new energy-efficient
      motor under any of the following conditions:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The cost of the rewind exceeds 65% of the price of a new motor</li>
        <li>The motor was rewound before 1980</li>
      </ul>

        75% with drastic decreases in efficiency below about 50%. If this is the case, consider replacing your motor with
        a correctly sized motor.

        Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical work the motor performs and the electrical power it consumes
        to do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage represents a more efficient motor. Electric motor
        efficiency is dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, rating, load, power quality, and
        operating conditions. Enter this value as a percentage.

        Rewinding a motor usually comes with a loss in efficiency somewhere between 1 and 2%. When considering the choice between
        rewinding a standard efficiency motor or purchasing a new high efficiency motor, the difference in efficiency is
        around 4 to 5% in favor of the high efficiency motor, which will also have a much longer service life.
