          Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical 
          work the motor performs and the electrical power it consumes to 
          do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage 
          represents a more efficient motor. Electric motor efficiency is 
          dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, 
          rating, load, power quality, and operating conditions. 
          Enter this value as a percentage.

          The ratio of the average load the motor draws when it is in 
          operation to full rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually 
          around 75% with drastic decreases in efficiency below about 50%. 
          If this is the case, consider replacing your motor with a correctly sized motor.
