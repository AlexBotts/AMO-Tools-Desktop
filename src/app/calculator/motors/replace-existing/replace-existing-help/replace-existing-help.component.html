    <h3>Replace Existing Motor - Efficiency Upgrade</h3>
    <p>
      Improving the energy efficiency of an electric motor can save energy, reduce operating costs, and improve productivity. Usually,
      the annual energy cost of running a motor is many times greater than its initial purchase price. For this reason, even
      a small efficiency improvement in motors that are large or have high operating hours can make financial sense. Consider
      buying an energy-efficient motor in the following circumstances:
      <li> For all new installations</li>
      <li> When purchasing equipment packages</li>
      <li> When major modifications are made to the facility or process</li>
      <li> To replace oversized and underloaded motors</li>
      <li> As part of a preventive maintenance or energy conservation program </li>

          Motor efficiency is the ratio between the amount of mechanical work the motor performs and the electrical power it consumes
          to do the work, represented by a percentage. A higher percentage represents a more efficient motor. Electric motor
          efficiency is dependent on (but not limited to) design, materials, construction, rating, load, power quality, and
          operating conditions. Enter this value as a percentage.

          The ratio of the average load the motor draws when it is in operation to full rated load. Maximum efficiency is usually around
          75% with drastic decreases in efficiency below about 50%. If this is the case, consider replacing your motor with
          a correctly sized motor.
