        <label>Application</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Enhanced: Added absolute temperature scales (Kelvin and Rankine) to unit converter</li>
          <li>Added: Ability to rename an export within the export box to reduce possibility of deleting the .json from the file
            name in windows</li>
          <li>Updated: Top bar navigation. The House Icon directs to the home screen; the folder icon directs to "All Assessments"</li>
        </ul>
        <label>PSAT</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: General bug and text fixes</li>
          <li>Enhanced: Added results to the right side of System Setup - Field Data</li>
        </ul>
        <label>PHAST</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed: General bug and text fixes</li>
          <li>Fixed: Navigation - Next button on "Other Losses" page of System Setup now directs to "Aux Equipment"</li>
        </ul>
        <label>FSAT</label>
        <ul>
          <li>New Feature: Fan Assessment Tool- similar to the pump tool, this allows users to compare current fan setups to
            modification scenarios to analyze potential savings</li>
          <li>Added: Popup calculators for estimating fan inlet/outlet pressures based on estimations of system losses</li>
          <li>Added: Popup calculator for the calculation of fan inlet and outlet pressures and flow based on a pitot tube traverse
            in accordance with AMCA 203</li>
          <li>Added: Fan Reports and Sankeys</li>
        </ul>
        <label>Calculators</label>
        <ul>
          <li>Added: Replace Motor Calculator - Calculate the energy savings, cost savings, and payback period for replacing
            an existing motor with a higher efficiency motor.</li>
          <li>Added: Replace vs. Rewind Calculator - Compare the cost and energy expenditure of rewinding a failed motor versus
            replacing it with a new energy-efficient model.</li>
          <li>Added: Operating points calculator - Calculation of fan inlet and outlet pressures, flow, and energy use based
            on a pitot tube traverse in accordance with AMCA 203</li>
          <li>Added: Fan curve calculator - Develop fan curves, adopted from pump curve calculator</li>
          <li>Added: System curve calculator - to develop fan system curves, adopted from pump system curve calculator</li>
          <li>Enhanced: Steam Properties and Saturated Properties graphs - smoothed constant temperature lines</li>
          <li>Enhanced: Added popup modals to many calculator graphs to enlarge graphs</li>
          <li>Enhanced: Added ability to click on line graphs and create a table with the data</li>
        </ul>
        <label>Known Issues</label>
        <ul>
          <li>The Mac and Linux releases have significantly slower app start times than in previous builds</li>
          <li>Renaming an export in Windows Download menu can delete the file extension (.json)</li>
          <li>Assessments made in a previous release may experience errors</li>
          <li>Import files made in a previous release will not be useable</li>
